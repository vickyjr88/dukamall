# Server-side deployment for the Dubai Merchants Shops Platform. Mirrors
# drip-crm's scripts/deploy.sh structure exactly -- same rolling-deploy
# mechanics, different port block (see docker-compose.yml) so both stacks can
# run on the same host without colliding. Safe to run by hand on the VPS too:
#
#   cd /opt/shops-platform && ./scripts/deploy.sh
#
# Expects a populated .env in the deploy directory (never committed, never
# written by CI) and the repo already checked out on the target branch.
#
# Rolling deploy, not stop-and-restart: web/backend each have two slots
# (web/web2, backend/backend2 in docker-compose.yml) published on two
# different host ports. nginx's upstream pool for each app lists both ports
# at all times (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), so whichever slot is actually
# listening gets the traffic and nginx's own passive health check routes
# around a slot that is down. That means this script never has to touch
# nginx/aaPanel on a normal deploy -- it only ever starts the *idle* slot on
# the new image, waits for it to pass its own healthcheck directly (not
# through nginx), and only then stops the slot that was serving. There is
# never a moment where both slots are down at once. This matters more here
# than for a single-tenant app: a deploy-caused outage takes every shop on
# the platform down at once, not just one merchant's site.
#
# Which slot is "active" (the one nginx should mostly be sending traffic to,
# and the one this script will replace) is tracked in .deploy-active-slot
# next to this script's working directory -- Compose has no notion of this
# itself. Slot "a" = web/backend on WEB_PORT/API_PORT. Slot "b" = web2/
# backend2 on WEB_PORT2/API_PORT2.
